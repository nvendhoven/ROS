\section{Introduction}

For the Real-time Operating Systems course (ROS01) taught at Rotterdam University of Applied Science,
the authors had to implement a scheduler for a Real-time Operating System developed by one lecturers.
Because these types of programming issues like implementing a scheduler require the programmer to be able to program at a low level and it cannot be assumed that every student following this course is familiar with low level progamming (both in the C programming language and assembler), this course contains multiple assingments to bridge this gap.

\section{Toggling LEDs bottom-up}

The purpose of the first assignment is to become familiar with low level programming.
This is done by toggling LEDs using different levels of abstraction.
The sequence of this \enquote{LED show} can be seen in Table \ref{tab:led_scheme}.
Between every sequence should be a delay of approximately 1 second.
